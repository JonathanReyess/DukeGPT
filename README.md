- **Feedback**: The dialog prompts users to provide feedback, collects their input,and stores it in Azure Blob Storage for easy access.
- **Unknown Intent**: Deals with unknown user intents by routing to our configured GPT 3.5 Turbo model. 
- **Person**: Manages conversations related to a person.
- **Reminder Conversation**: Action is performed automatically when there is no interaction between the user and bot within a timeframe.
- **Session Expire Conversation**: Manages when the session expires due to lack of activity.
- **EndConvo**: Ends the conversation, stores chat history in our Blob Storage and sends an email to the user with Azure Logic Apps.
